# Substrate Moss material for Unreal 

I followed the awesome tutorial below to create this moss material.
You can paint it on your trees or anything.

Here is the link to the video demonstrating it's us and how the material was created.  I just packaged it up for easy use so you can download the release Substrate_Moss.zip.  There is no source code in this repository as it is too large so I am just attaching the zip code as a way to store this file.
